    title: "Unused FAULT_RESPONSE constant in main.rs"
    status: open
    sprint: PI001/SP001
    created_by: reviewer
    created_at: 2026-02-10
    resolved_at: null
    notes: "Constant FAULT_RESPONSE defined but never used. Either implement process fault handling or remove constant. Not critical for SP001 functionality."

    severity: high
    type: techdebt
    title: "Watchdog disable not implemented"
    status: open
    sprint: PI001/SP001
    created_by: reviewer
    created_at: 2026-02-10
    resolved_at: null
    notes: "TODO at main.rs:132. Watchdog not disabled may cause unexpected resets after 1-2 seconds. Critical for hardware stability. Should be implemented in SP002."

    severity: medium
    type: techdebt
    title: "Clock configuration not implemented"
    status: open
    sprint: PI001/SP001
    created_by: reviewer
    created_at: 2026-02-10
    resolved_at: null
    notes: "TODO at main.rs:133. Running on bootloader default clocks. Should implement PCR-based clock configuration in SP002 for optimal performance."

    severity: high
    type: techdebt
    title: "INTC driver not implemented - placeholder interrupt handling"
    status: open
    sprint: PI001/SP001
    created_by: reviewer
    created_at: 2026-02-10
    resolved_at: null
    notes: "chip.rs has placeholder interrupt handling. service_pending_interrupts() and has_pending_interrupts() are stubs. handle_interrupt() just re-enables interrupts. Real INTC driver needed in SP002 for proper interrupt routing."
